# App List #

Simple android app to view all your installed apps and save the ones you use the most.

This started off as a weekend proof of concept challenge, it then turned into an app that I used and got value from, so was rewritten from scratch.

## Features ##

- See all apps currently installed on your device, or all apps you have saved
- Save an app that is installed, or add one manually
- Share an app from the playstore to save, like a wishlist
- Favourite a saved app
- Add notes to a saved app
- Material 3 design, using the users color pallete
